## Day 4

###### DENALI NATIONAL PARK

South out of Fairbanks is the Parks Highway (Hwy. 3), which runs past Denali National Park and Preserve and down to the Richardson Highway just north of Anchorage. This highway was only completed in 1972 opening this stretch to motor vehicle traffic. Along its length is the Alaska Railroad, which run from Seward and Whittier on the Kenai Peninsula to Fairbanks. We will travel the whole 362-mile length, but today we will just concern ourselves with the section to Denali. The road begins to rise as we again approach the crest of the Alaska Range.

## Day 5 and 6

Denali National Park is Alaska’s most popular land attraction—and with good reason. You can see some of Alaska’s most famous sights:

* Mt. McKinley and the continent’s highest peaks.
* A vast, unspoiled wilderness of braided glacial rivers, massive peaks, and tundra.
* Lots of wildlife: Moose, caribou, grizzly bears, Dall sheep, and wolves.

National park offers bus shuttles in and out of the park. Driving is not permitted . Make sure to book tickets in advance- [http://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/shuttles.htm](http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast "http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast") Highly recommended to camp out one night in one of the camp grounds.
